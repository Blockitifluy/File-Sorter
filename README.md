# File-Sorter
The Python File Explorer is used to easily sort files from one folder of unsorted content to an another folder.

## How does it work
It uses: 
* os
* Tkinter (Making the UI)
* shuttil (Adding and Cloning files)
<p>to achieve the sorting system, as well as if it exists it uses a Fullname or else just use the extension name (Free to update the list)</p>
